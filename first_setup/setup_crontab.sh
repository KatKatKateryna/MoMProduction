#!/bin/bash
# setup_crontab.sh — Installs MoMProduction cron jobs for all data-source runs.
# The monitor job is intentionally excluded; add it separately if needed.
#
# Usage:
#   chmod +x first_setup/setup_crontab.sh   # make executable (only needed once)
#   ./first_setup/setup_crontab.sh
#
# Jobs are launched through run_mom_job.sh, which activates the conda
# environment before calling MoM_run.py. Calling the env's python by absolute
# path is NOT sufficient: without activation the env's bin/ is missing from
# PATH and the GDAL/PROJ activate.d hooks never run, so console tools such as
# gdal_translate cannot be resolved and image products are silently skipped.
#
# Safe to re-run — strips existing MoM entries (both the current
# run_mom_job.sh form and the legacy direct MoM_run.py form) before appending
# the definitions below fresh. All other cron jobs are untouched.
